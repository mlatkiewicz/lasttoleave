							<h4>What is it?</h4>
							<p>A monthly virtual table read of different plays. No pressure—just passion, creativity, and connection!<p>
							<h4>How it works</h4>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Community chooses a play:</strong> every month, we'll post a handful of plays to choose from. The community votes on what we'll read</li>
								<li><strong>"Casting":</strong> community members identify which parts they'd like to read and we cast it based on who hasn't read in a while (the idea is everyone gets a chance to be in a cast every couple months)</li>
								<li><strong>Single rehearsal:</strong> actors gather for one pre-read session to handle logistics, tech, and a little dramaturgy magic</li>
								<li><strong>Showtime:</strong> One or two informal Zoom performances potentially with two different casts to share unique takes on the roles with friends and fellow theater-lovers across the country.</li>

						<p>Directed by <a href="https://paulghogan.com/">Paul Hogan</a></p>

						<p>It’s that rare time of year when <strong>Life Plan </strong> comes through the Los Angeles Habitable Zone! Tired of struggling in underground shelters and fleeing from mutated puss mutts? Life Plan <em>is the answer</em>. You <em>can</em> live out your dream life and you <em>can</em> experience true fulfillment, but only if you come to one of our five Life Plan Invitation Presentations this June. This is your last chance of 2068, so don’t miss out!</p>
						<p>Life Plan is immersive satirical sci-fi — you’re live at a timeshare sales pitch from our dystopian future. Fulfillment is the offer. Salvation is the opportunity. <em>Will you buy in?</em></p>
						<blockquote>"Chilling! Terrifying! Stunning!  The commodification of wisdom, the bastardization of motivation, the commercialization of truth, the epitome of modern advertising, the trivialization of the human psyche, and the bitter culmination of capitalism."

					<h3>This is how we feel</h3>
				  	</header>
					<p>Last To Leave Theater Co. aim to make memorable theater that justifies its liveness in an increasingly digital world. We like theater that feels like <em>an event</em> and all our productions are anchored in the <em><strong>audience experience</strong></em>, giving people something they will never forget. Each production is site specific and probably not in a traditional theater space. Last to Leave is an experiment. Last to Leave is a flag planted in the real. Last to Leave will turn out the lights.</p>
